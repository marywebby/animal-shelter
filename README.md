# Animal Shelter App

  [![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://mit-license.org/)

  ## Description
  This application will allow users to access an animal shelter's website and interact with its many aspects by updating, viewing, and logging in and out. 
  ### Featured Page
  The website will include a featured page, displaying our adoptable critters. 
  ### Adoption Page
  If you toggle to the adoption page, the user will be able to filter through the list of animals by their sex, what type of animal they are, and whether they are hypoallergenic. 
  ### Missing Pages
  We also have two ‘missing’ pages. Our first 'missing' page allows users to view missing animals that were posted by other users. Our 'post a missing animal' page allows users to login, add details about their missing animal, and posting the information to our missing animals page.
